For compiling under Windows, there are several options
regarding which compiler to chose. This selection has
to be done by hand by setting the MAKE_UNAME environment
variable:

  MAKE_UNAME=CYGWIN_NT-5.0 (default)  using GNU C/C++ compiler

  MAKE_UNAME=VisualC		      using Microsoft Visual C/C++

  MAKE_UNAME=IntelC		      using Intel C/C++
