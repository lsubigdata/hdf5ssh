<H1>The Art of writing a GNUmakefile.rules file</H1>

<UL>
<LI> <A HREF="#make_root"> Specifying the MAKE_ROOT variable</A>:<BR>
	The <TT>GNUmakefile.rules</TT> file must set the MAKE_ROOT variable such
	that the make components provided by the makefile configuration systems work
	correctly. There are various ways to do so, which on to use is mainly a matter
	of taste.<P>
<LI> <A HREF="#novpath"> Rules file for compiling a library in the current directory</A>:<BR>
	If you just want to compile all files in the current directory, like a
	usual make does. This might be most familiar to most make users, but you will
	get a lot of temporary directories and you can't do program development for
	more than one architecture (the word `architecture' includes different
	compiler options/compilers on the same hardware architecture, too)
	without doing a make clean and remaking the whole thing. If you don't need
	this, these simple rules might be ok for you. Otherwise you may use the
	feautures of the VPATH mechanism.<P>
<LI> <A HREF="#vpath"> Rules file using the VPATH mechanism </A>:<BR>
	All temporary and/or architecture specific files are put into
	a separate directory apart from the source code directory. Your
	source code directory will always be kept clean and you can develop
	for multiple architectures in parallel. A rules file using the
	VPATH mechanism is somewhat more complex, but usually it's worth
	the effort.

<A NAME=make_root>
<H3>Various ways of specifying the required MAKE_ROOT variable</H3>
</A>

All makefile components require the variable <B><TT>MAKE_ROOT</TT></B> to be
set to the top directory of your application or a parent directory of the
make configuration system directory<TT>make</TT> by which the applications
to be handled are accessible. This can be done in several ways:

<UL>
<LI>
Setting the environment variable <B><TT>MAKE_ROOT</B></TT> in the shell.
<P>
E.g. in ksh/bash:
<TABLE><TR><TD BGCOLOR=#C0C0C0>
<PRE>

home: $ export MAKE_ROOT=/usr/local/application/
</PRE>
</TD></TR></TABLE>

in csh/tcsh:
<TABLE><TR><TD BGCOLOR=#C0C0C0>
<PRE>

home: % setenv MAKE_ROOT /usr/local/application/
</PRE>
</TD></TR></TABLE>

Setting the MAKE_ROOT environment variable can be done in the
local user's shell profile (.bashrc, .cshrc).
<P>

<LI>
In case that using an environment variable is not desired,
e.g. because one has to deal with more than one application
(and correspondingly with multiple toplevel GNUmakefile.rules files),
and changing the MAKE_ROOT variable when changing between these
applications is too unconvenient (or considered to be too error-prone),
one can assign an application specific environment variable to
the MAKE_ROOT make variable within the GNUmakefile.rules file of that
application where this assignment must precede any other lines and
usually is the first line.<P>

<EM>Referring to another variable:</EM>
<TABLE><TR><TD BGCOLOR=#C0C0C0>
<PRE>

MAKE_ROOT=$(APPLICATION_ROOTDIR)
</PRE>
</TD></TR></TABLE>

The environment variable <B><TT>APPLICATION_ROOTDIR</TT></B> must still
be set in the shell, as in the former case. However, several such
variables may now coexist.
<P>

<LI>
In case even setting an application-specific environment variable is too
inconvenient, the <TT>MAKE_ROOT</TT> variable may be a path which is
relative to a target's directory.
This is the worst solution, because all targets of this application
must then reside at the same subdirectory level, relative to the 
application top level directory.
However, an enviroment variable $(APPLICATION_ROOTDIR) needs not be set,
and this is useful for direct compilation of some source code that has
been extracted from a distribution file.
<P>
<EM>Using a target-relative path (example):</EM>

<TABLE><TR><TD BGCOLOR=#C0C0C0>
<PRE>

MAKE_ROOT=$(VPATH)..
</PRE>
</TD></TR></TABLE>

Setting MAKE_ROOT as in this example requires all targets to reside in a
direct child directory of the application root directory.
For generality, please use the VPATH variable when
specifying directories, which are relative to the target directory.
Normally, $(VPATH) is empty, but in special cases (i.e. when the
<A HREF=#vpath>VPATH</A> mechanism is used) it might contain the
full path to the target directory. In this case, the current directory
is <B>not</B> the target directory.

<P>
The make configuration system configuration files <tt>autoselect.cfg</tt>
may be included to set the make variables <TT><B>MAKE_UNAME</B></TT>,
<TT><B>MAKE_CFG</B></TT> and <TT><B>MAKE_HOSTNAME</B></TT>.
One may set these variables by hand or from other environment variables,
since usually there is a standard way to set these, it is recommended
to let <TT><A HREF="autoselect.html">autoselect.cfg</A></TT> find out
their values.
<P>
It is also recommended to include <tt><A HREF="make.html">make.cfg</A></tt> 
in the GNUmakefile.rules file to set a couple 
of predefined architecture-specific make variables.
These variables are used in several places to compile and make targets - 
this is one of the conventions mentioned before.
<P>
The target library is generated using the make rules
contained in $(MAKE_ROOT)/make/lib.rules,
i.e. the target `lib' is defined there.
$(MAKE_ROOT)/make/lib.rules `defines' (by convention) the make variables
$(OBJS) and $(TARGET) that are expected to contain the names of the object
files names and the name of the library - `defines' in this case meaning
no more than occurrence as a make target resp. dependency of a rule.
Both variables should be set in a target-specific GNUmakefile which includes
this GNUmakefile.rules file, see <a href="GNUmakefile.html">example</a>
GNUmakefile. This way several libraries can be generated using only this
common single GNUmakefile.rules file.

[comment: This text is too complex...!]

A `gmake' call on a GNUmakefile that includes this example GNUmake.rules file
should be made without target specification or equivalently with default
target `all' or with target `compilelib'. The latter is expected as the value
of the variable VPATH_TARGET within the included `vpath.rules' file which 
is a standard rules files of the make configuration system that contains a 
rule by which object files can be put into another directory than source 
files. This rule makes use of the GNUmake VPATH mechanism in the following 
way: It has VPATH_TARGET as target, encodes a change of directory to another 
one given by the variable $VPATH_MAKEDIR whose default is $OBJ_PATH, i.e. 
to the preset object file directory $OBJ_PATH by default, sets the $VPATH
variable to the current directory where the sources and the GNUmakefile
are deposited, and calls `gmake' again on that same GNUmakefile (generating 
a fully qualified pathname for invoking the latter from the $VPATH_MAKEDIR
directory) with target `vpath_compilelib' (being composed from the fixed
string `vpath_' and the $(VPATH_TARGET) target string). Thus the rule with
target `lib' which is contained in the `lib.rules' file of the make
configuration system and really creates the library is invoked and
executed in the object file directory where object files are expected and
remade if necessary by invoking a rule for compilation contained in the
`suffixes.rules' file provided by the make configuration system, the
path to source files being given by $VPATH. No change is required in the
GNUmakefile of the source code directory, unless of course, the target 
`lib' is quoted there explicitely in which case it only has to be replaced
by `compilelib'.

<A NAME=depend>
<H3>Support for makefile dependencies generated during compilation</H3>
</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Some compilers are able to generate information about dependencies for
object files automatically during compilation.
They write the dependency information of source code components on header files 
in a make-compatible format to files, which can then be included in a makefile. 
<P>
This way rules for recompiling objects will be used for the next make run 
if any header file has changed. How this is done in detail is predefined in the makefile
configuration system for a couple of architectures, so the user or
writer of an application rules file does not need to care about this.
The name(s) of the dependcy information file(s) s contained in the make
variable ${MAKEDEPENDENCIES}.
<P>
The recommended way to add this dynamic dependency information to
the current make system is as follows:

<TABLE><TR><TD BGCOLOR=#C0C0C0>
<PRE>
#
# Support for makefile dependencies generated during compilation
#
-include $(MAKEDEPENDENCIES)

depclean::
        $(RM) $(OBJ_PATH)/$(MAKEDEPENDENCIES)

</PRE>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
The target <B><TT>depclean</TT></B> removes all dependency information, which is
sometimes required if the header files are restructured and, e.g., some header
file does no longer exist.

#

TARGET_DIRS=dir1 dir2 dir3

</PRE>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
If the root directory of your application contains several subdirectories
and each of them a makefile that must be executed to build the entire
application, make execution in subdirectories can be invoked from the 
root level make file by including the <TT><B>multiple.rules</B></TT> file in the
latter and setting the make variable TARGET_DIRS to contain a list of
subdirectories as in the example. Recursive make execution  with respect
to a directory tree can be invoked in the same way, i.e. the 
<em>multiple.rules</em> file can be included in the makefile of each
intermediate directory.
