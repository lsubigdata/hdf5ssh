<H1>if's in Makefiles</H1>

<H3>The problem</H3>
When writing compile commands for multiple platforms,
if-statements are really essential.
E.g. if you have to write a program for the two platforms
IRIX and HP-UX (the names are chosen freely, could be anything
else), you may want to use a library called `irix' under IRIX and
a library called `hpux' under HPUX.
<P>
<B>Example:</B><BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD BGCOLOR=#C0C0C0>
<B>compile command for `progname.c' under IRIX:</B>
<PRE>
IRIX: $ cc progname.c -lirix
</PRE>
<B>compile command for `progname.c' under IRIX:</B>
<PRE>
HP-UX: $ cc progname.c -lhpux
</PRE>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>

This problem often occurs when writing multi-platform makefiles.
Three kinds of possible solutions are presented here.
Let us assume that the current machine type is stored in
a make variable called <TT>MAKE_UNAME</TT>, i.e.
under IRIX:
<PRE>
MAKE_UNAME = IRIX
</PRE>
and under HP-UX:
<PRE>
MAKE_UNAME = HP-UX
</PRE>
We would then like to set a make variable <TT>LIBS</TT> to contain
the text <TT>-lirix</TT> or <TT>-lhpux</TT>, depending on <TT>MAKE_UNAME</TT>,
such that the final command line in the make file looks like this:
<TABLE><TR><TD BGCOLOR=#C0C0C0>
<PRE>

cc progname.c $(LIBS)
</PRE>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
There are three ways to accomplish this goal:

<H3>If's using GNU make</H3>
GNU make intrinsically supports if-statements.
It would be straightforward to directly use this feature
(if using GNU make instead of standard make is no problem):

<TABLE><TR><TD BGCOLOR=#C0C0C0>
<PRE>

ifeq ($(MAKE_UNAME), IRIX)
LIBS=-lirix
endif

ifeq ($(MAKE_UNAME), HP-UX)
LIBS=-lhpux
endif
</PRE>
</TD></TR></TABLE>

However, there are some other methods, which are shorter in writing
and easier to read, once you are familiar with this kind
of `if-statement'.

<H3>Recursive evaluation</H3>
Most standard makefiles (unfortunately not all of them) support
recursive evaluation of make variables. This means that a make
variable may contain the name of another make variable.
Using this mechanism, the `if-statement' could be written this way:
<TABLE><TR><TD BGCOLOR=#C0C0C0>
<PRE>

LIBS_IRIX  = -lirix
LIBS_HP-UX = -lhpux

LIBS=$(LIBS_${MAKE_UNAME})
</PRE>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
When variable <TT><B>LIBS</B></TT> is used, it is searched as the value
of the variable <TT><B>LIBS_${MAKE_UNAME}</B></TT>, which is, depending
on <TT><B>MAKE_UNAME</B></TT>, either <TT><B>LIBS_IRIX</B></TT> or <TT><B>LIBS_HP-UX</B></TT>.
<P>
The advantage of this mechanism is that only a single line is required for each
platform-configuration, whereas three lines are necessary for each platform
when using direct if-statements. So this is more compact and remains as
readable as it is when adding more platforms.
<P>
Using () or {} for variable evaluation is mainly a question of taste, both ways
are equivalent for the make program. However some make programs have problems with
recursive evaluation when identical brackets are used, since they do not 
parse brackets recursively, but look for the first closing bracket after the first opening bracket.
Clearly this way recursive evaluation does not work, but using different
kinds of brackets circumvents this problem.

<H4>Advanced</H4>
A more advanced feature (but possibly harder to understand) feature of
recursive evaluation is that it takes place at the point where a recursively
defined variable is <b>evaluated</b>, not at the place of definition or
assignment. This means that in the above example the variable
<TT><B>MAKE_UNAME</B></TT> needs not to be defined when <TT><B>LIBS</B></TT> 
is defined to be a recursive variable and <TT><B>MAKE_UNAME</B></TT>
may be assigned some value <B>after</B>
definition of <TT><B>LIBS</B></TT> (if it is defined more than once, the last
occurance in the makefile counts:
<TABLE><TR><TD BGCOLOR=#C0C0C0>
<PRE>

LIBS=$(LIBS_${MAKE_UNAME})

MAKE_UNAME = HP-UX
</PRE>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
This will also work and assignes the value of <TT><B>LIBS_HP-UX</B></TT>
to  <TT><B>LIBS</B></TT>.
<P>
And this will, of course, also works if the assignment to the LIBS-variable
is done in some included makefile and an assignment to MAKE_UNAME appears
after inclusion of this makefile:

<TABLE><TR><TD BGCOLOR=#C0C0C0>
<B>File: libs-definition.cfg</B>
<PRE>
LIBS_IRIX  = -lirix
LIBS_HP-UX = -lhpux

LIBS=$(LIBS_${MAKE_UNAME})
</PRE>
<B>File: Makefile</B>
<PRE>
include libs-definition.cfg

MAKE_UNAME = HP-UX
</PRE>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
This way, a user can chose a value from multiple definitions in a file
<TT>libs-definition.cfg</TT> (which defines a couple of <TT>LIBS</TT>-Variables).
The advantage against setting <TT>MAKE_UNAME</TT> <EM>before</EM> the configuration
file is included is that the configuration file itself may set <TT>MAKE_UNAME</TT>
to some default value. So the user is not expected to set <TT>MAKE_UNAME</TT> by himself,
but he may, if he wants to do so. This clearly does not work if he tries to
set <TT>MAKE_UNAME</TT> before the definition file is included.
<P>
The last assignment of <TT>MAKE_UNAME</TT> counts.

<H3>File inclusion</H3>

When more than one variable is to be set depending on another variable,
it may be handy to set all these variables at once, using the name of
that variable directly without `intermediate variables' for recursive
evaluation, This can be achieved using GNU-make's intrinsic if-statements
or by using variable-specific file inclusion:
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD BGCOLOR=#C0C0C0>

<B>File: libs-IRIX.cfg</B>
<PRE>
LIBS = -lirix
...
</PRE>
<B>File: libs-HP-UX.cfg</B>
<PRE>
LIBS = -lhp-ux
...
</PRE>
<B>File: Makefile</B>
<PRE>
include libs-$(MAKE_UNAME).cfg
</PRE>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
(Variable LIBS is set correctly now.)
<P>
An advantage is that all variables specific to one platform are kept at 
one place. A disadvantage is that you need multiple files. However, for
applications which use more than one makefile (which is the case for
any larger application consisting of multiple libraries and programs),
this is an advantage because all of these single makefiles may
include the same configuration files and get the same definitions,
which are therefore insured to be identical and compatible.

<H4>Advanced</H4>
Another advantage is that default values for variables can easily 
be defined. E.g. if the definitions for <TT>IRIX</TT> are also suitable
for <TT>HP-UX</TT>, but some changes are required for <TT>HP-UX</TT> as 
well, the <TT>IRIX</TT> file can be included unconditionally
and the <TT>HP-UX</TT> file depending on the platform:
<TABLE><TR><TD BGCOLOR=#C0C0C0>
<PRE>

include libs-IRIX.cfg
include libs-$(MAKE_UNAME).cfg
</PRE>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
Under HP-UX, the definitions of <TT>libs-IRIX.cfg</TT> are read
and possibly overridden by the definitions in <TT>libs-HP-UX.cfg</TT>.
Under IRIX, the definitions of <TT>libs-IRIX.cfg</TT> are read twice,
which is quite harmless.
<P>
The <A HREF="">makefile configuration system</A> is based on these
mechanisms.
