<H1>The autoselect configuration file</H1>

The purpose of the <tt><B>autoselect.cfg</B></tt>
configuration file is to set the make variables which
contain required information about the current system
and make configuration:
<UL>
<LI> <TT><B>MAKE_UNAME</B></TT> is nearly the output
	of the `<TT><B>uname</B></TT>' utility. It is
	used to identify the current hardware architecture.
<LI> <TT><B>MAKE_CFG</B></TT> is some kind of configuration
	for the current hardware architecture. The mostly used
	configuration types are <TT><B>Debug</B></TT> and
	<TT><B>Optimize</B></TT>, but there may be other configuration
	types, too (depending if there is an architecture configuration
	file, see <A HREF="make.html">make.cfg</A> for details).
<LI> <TT><B>MAKE_HOSTNAME</B></TT> is used for additional host-specific
	configurations, e.g. the path of locally installed libraries,
	which reside on non-standard places on each host.
</UL>
All these variables may be set by hand instead, but autoselect.cfg
tries to automatically select the appropriate values by itself
(by calling `uname' and `hostname').
<P>
Please note that the automatically generated MAKE_UNAME and
MAKE_CFG variables
have to correspond to the architecture string which is 
generated by the `<A HREF="arch.html">arch<A>' script.
