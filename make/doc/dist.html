<H1>Rules for creating distribution files</H1>

<H2>Concept</H2>

The purpose of <em>dist.rules</em> is to create distributable .tar.gz files out
of an existing source code directory and/or a compiled source code tree. 
The distribution may be of the kind
<UL>
<LI> source code distribution: The complete source directory 
	(make target <TT>srcdist</TT>)
<LI> developer's distribution: Compiled code (binary library) + header files 
	(make target <TT>devdist</TT>)
<LI> binary distribution: Compiled code only (binaries, shared libraries,...)
	(make targe <TT>bindist</TT>)
</UL>
The directory or source code tree root from which a distribution file is to be
created is expected to be given in ${DIST_ROOT} (= ${MAKE_ROOT} by default) or
to be a subdirectory of ${DIST_ROOT}; the name of such a subdirectory or
application component is expected to be given in the make variable ${TARGET}
which should be set in the makefile of the target component or a in a
GNUmake.rules file where the name of the target component currently in the
make is likely to be known anyway.
<P>
Distribution files are put into the directory ${DISTDIR} (= ${MAKE_ROOT}/dist
by default), filenames in the .tar.gz file are relative to this one. The
distribution files are created such that they can be unpacked into a new
${MAKE_ROOT} directory, thus a complete distribution can be used in the same
way as the original version.
<P>
If the current source tree or the directory containing the compiled code is not
a subdirectory of ${DISTDIR} the dist rules will store absolute path names into
the distribution files.

<H2>Usage</H2>

Please remember that `make help.dist' gives an overview of the make rules
available by including this rule file, and `make makevars.dist' gives a description
of the make variables that affect the functionality of this rule file.
To examine the contents of these make variables, type `make debug.dist'.
<P>
By default, the <tt>srcdist:</tt> rule takes the whole source tree and packs
it into a distribution file. The source files may reside in a subdirectory of
${DIST_ROOT_SRC}, which by default is identical to ${DIST_ROOT}.
<P>
<P>
In the following the shorthand xxxdist will be used for {src|dev|bin}dist,
respectively.
<P>
 The name of the distribution file (including directory prefix) may be specified 
in the variables ${XXX_TAR_GZ}, where ${XXX_TAR} is predefined to be
<PRE>
SRC_TAR=${DISTDIR}/${TARGET}-src.tar
DEV_TAR=${DISTDIR}/${TARGET}-${arch}-dev.tar
BIN_TAR=${DISTDIR}/${TARGET}-${arch}.tar
</PRE>
The name of the distribution file must be defined prior to inclusion of
dist.rules.
<P>
Each xxxdist rules has a `constructor' dependency ${xxxdist.ctor} and a
`destructor' dependency ${xxxdist.dtor}, these variables may be set to hold
the name of make targets that are made just before resp. after the 
distribution file is generated. This is useful for creating additional
files that are to be put into the distribution but will not be used otherwise.
For example, to put an additional file `dist-only.txt' into a source 
distribution file, GNUmakefile should contain lines like the following:
<PRE>
srcdist.ctor = create-txt
srcdist.dtor = delete-txt

include $(MAKE_ROOT)/make/dist.rules

create-txt:
	echo This file is in the distribution only > dist-only.txt

delete-txt:
	-rm dist-only.txt
</PRE>
Similarly, constructor/destructor rules may be used to delete/recreate
files during the process of creating a distribution file.
<P>
The special rule <TT>xxxdist.etc::</TT> is executed after creation of an uncompressed
.tar file, prior to compression. By adding commands to the multiple xxxdist.etc::
rule, arbitrary files can be added to the tar file currently under construction.
E.g. global config files could be included in a distribution this way
