<H1>Rules for external componenents</H1>

<H2>Concept</H2>

The purpose of <em>external.rules</em> is to provide make targets for
libraries which are somehow used within an application, but are not
part of the source code being developed. An external target may be
any component that is required for making other targets. A rule with
an external target may involve a search for some files, e.g. for the 
X11 or jpeg library, and setting flags according to the result by `make'.
An external target may be considered as a component of a configuration
utilitity, comparable to GNU's `configure', but the `external' target 
is just one such element for a specific purpose. It may also be 
exchanged by some other component, e.g. a binary distribution of an
installed library (which is only referenced by an external makefile) or
by a full source code distribution, which is handled like any other 
source code target.
<P>
An external target rule searches/configures an external component to make 
it available to other targets.

<H2>Usage</H2>

In general, an external component contains a makefile with information
where to put files for a specific architecture and which variables are
associated to this architecture. There are no restrictions to the behaviour 
of an external makefile, it could do anything related to the underlying
component (e.g. call `configure' or `imake', etc.).
<P>
Normally, an external target does not use the default target of an included
GNUmakefile.rules file, so a simple external makefile typically starts like
this:
<PRE>
this_all: do_external

include $(VPATH)../GNUmakefile.rules

do_external:
	...
</PRE>
In <TT>do_external</TT> any rule may be given, which makes use of variables
like CFLAGS or LIB_PATH etc.

<P>
Among the rules provided in <em>external.rules</em> there are some to set make
variables depending on the behaviour of an external makefile. These rules
are set up such as to intrinsically match the rest of the makefile 
configuration system. They may replace the ones referenced by the 
<TT>do_external</TT> word in the above example, or they may be used in
addition to them.

<H4>Unconditional externals</H4>
Unconditional externals are components which are likely to be used by many
components and should be visible to all other components. To <b>force</b>
visibility of an external target a rule
<TT><B>global-config:</B></TT> is provided by the make configuration system
which modifies the global MAKE variables <TT>SYSCFLAGS</TT> and
<TT>LDFLAGS</TT>:
<PRE>
	SYSCFLAGS+=$(TARGET_CFLAGS)
	LDFLAGS+=$(TARGET_LDFLAGS)
</PRE>
The variables TARGET_CFLAGS and TARGET_LDFLAGS have to be defined in the external
target's Makefile. Their values are used in addition to other configuration-defined
variable values for compiling <EM>any</EM> other component.


<H4>Conditional externals</H4>
Conditional externals are components that may not be present but may be used
by other components if they are available and can be found somehow. To <b>allow</b>
visibility of an external target to other makefile targets a rule
<tt><b>visible:</b></tt> is provided by the make configuration system which sets
the global MAKE variables $(TARGET)_FLAGS and $(TARGET)_LIB:
<PRE>
	$(TARGET)_FLAGS=$(TARGET_FLAGS)
	$(TARGET)_LIB=$(TARGET_LIB)
</PRE>
The variables TARGET_FLAGS and TARGET_LIB have to be defined in the external
Makefile. Then their values are - globally - available in the make 
variables $(TARGET)_FLAGS and $(TARGET)_LIB (after `make visible' has been
done for the external target).
<P>
E.g. a search for a library called <TT>libimg.a</TT> may be initiated in
the external makefile, and if this library is installed on the local system,
the source code of some targets is to be compiled with a compiler option
<TT>-Dwith_IMG</TT> as usually indicated by source code lines:
<PRE>
#ifdef with_IMG
	...
#endif
</PRE>
Then the external makefile must also contain the assignments
<PRE>
TARGET=IMG
TARGET_FLAGS=-Dwith_IMG
TARGET_LIB=-limg
</PRE>
(these flags may also contain <TT>-L&lt;dir&gt;</TT> or <TT>-I&lt;dir&gt;</TT> directives
for extending the compiler/linker search path)
<P>
Now, in the <EM>target makefile</EM>, where these flags are used, add 
the two lines
<PRE>
CFLAGS+=$(IMG_FLAGS)
LIBS  +=$(IMG_LIB)
</PRE>
If the external library could not be found
(or if there is no external makefile for this component at all),
<TT>$(IMG_FLAGS)</TT> and <TT>$(IMG_LIB)</TT> will be empty and the standard
variables <TT>CFLAGS</TT> and <TT>LIBS</TT> will be left unaltered.
<P>
<EM>Note:</EM> A Makefile target using conditional externals must be set up to correspond
to the external makefile, e.g. it must use the variable IMG_FLAGS, which is defined in an
external makefile with the target IMG. Therefore if a new conditional external is added
to a makefile configuration, all makefiles of components that are to benefit
from this new conditional external have to be modified accordingly (that
normally applies to the source codes as well). An unconditional external does 
not require any changes in target makefiles, any unconditional external becomes
visible to all other make targets immediatly.


<H3>Internals</H3>
Setting and extending global makefile variables is done by writing make commands
into an architecture-specific configuration file, namely <TT>$(LIB_PATH)/$(TARGET).cfg</TT>,
or <TT><B>$(TARGETCFG)</B></TT>. The contents of all <TT>.cfg</TT>-files in the
$(LIB_PATH) directory is used for each make run.
<P>
To remove the configuration variables for a specific target, the make
target <TT><b>remove-config:</b></TT> may be used. It simply removes the 
specified config file.

<H3>Searching</H3>

A problem arising with these provided targets is how to
get the correct values for <TT>TARGET_LDFLAGS</TT> or <TT>TARGET_LIBS</TT> etc. 
(which in most cases is a search path for an installed library or for include
 file).

<UL>
<LI> <B>Manual:</B><BR> The easiest way (for the makefile provider) is to let
	the user specify the values of these variables during invocation of make:
<PRE>
$ make visible "TARGET_FLAGS=-Dwith_IMG -I/usr/include/imglib/" "TARGET_LIB=-L/usr/local/img-lib/ -limg"
</PRE>
This will work in any case (even if externals are configrued automatically as
described below). The disadvantage is that this requires user interaction and
a user has to type these lines for any external target that is configured manually.
Moreover the user would have to be informed if this target has to be configured as
a conditional or unconditional one, although this information could be printed by the
default rule as some help message.
<P>

<LI> <B>Centrally configured</B><BR>
A common make include file might be provided for by all external makefiles,
e.g. a <TT>local-config.cfg</TT> of some kind. In this case all variables
for external packages may be set in this file, so the user may change some
default values, editing this file.
 E.g. the <TT>../local-config.cfg</TT> file could contain the lines
<PRE>
PATH_TO_IMGLIB=/usr/local/img-lib
INCLUDE_FOR_IMGLIB=/usr/include/imglib
</PRE>
and the corresponding external makefile would be:
<PRE>
TARGET=img

this_all: visible

include $(VPATH)../GNUmakefile.rules
include $(VPATH)../local-config.cfg

TARGET_FLAGS=-Dwith_IMG -I$(INCLUDE_FOR_IMGLIB)
TARGET_LIB  =-L$(PATH_TO_IMGLIB) -limg
</PRE>
<EM>Note:</EM>If the <TT>local-config.cfg</TT> file can be included by other target
makefiles and the external component is supposed to be unconditional, then it 
may contain lines for setting external package variables directly, e.g.
<TT>CFLAGS+=-I/usr/local/img-lib -Dwith_IMG</TT> etc.
There would be no need to use an external makefile at all in this case.
<P>

<LI> <B>Automatic:</B><BR>
The most advanced method is to search an external component using some search
script (preferably done in a shell).
This script would have to set the variables mentioned above.
For simplicity its output could directlty be written to the target
configuration file:
<PRE>
TARGET=X11

X11:    search 

include $(VPATH)../GNUmakefile.rules

search: $(LIB_PATH)
        ./search.sh > $(TARGETCFG)

</PRE>
(The $(LIB_PATH) dependency is required to create the LIB_PATH directory, where
the target configuration file will be stored, if this directory does not yet
exist.)
Now it is the task of the <TT>search.sh</TT> script to produce an output like
<PRE>
X11_FLAGS= -I/usr/X11R6/include -DWITH_X11
X11_LIBS = -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lX11
</PRE>
which has to be compatible with the unconditional/conditional structure
mentioned above. At least the provided variables must be used in makefiles
that are to make use of this external package.
