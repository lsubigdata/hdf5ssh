<H1>General properties of Rule files</H1>

<H2>Online Help</H2>

Each rule file provides a couple of rules.
The <B>help</B> target gives a list and description of all
targets which are useable by including a rule file.
Internal targets are not shown.
<P>
The <B>help</B> target is a multiple target, i.e. it may have
more than one rule. Any rule file adds more information to this
help target, printing the name of the rule file first.
If you wants to see the help text for a specific rule file only,
e.g. for `bin-shared.rules', use the single target
<B>help.bin-shared</B> (or generally: help. + &lt;<EM>rule file name</EM>&gt;).
<P>
Similar to the <B>help</B> target, the <B>makevars</B> and <B>debug</B>
targets are available, providing a list of used make variables and
their values, respectively.

<H2>Constructor/Destructor</H2>
</A>

For each target listed by the <B>help</B> commands two addtional targets 
`constructor' and `destructor' are provided by way of make variables which
are empty by default but can be specified expicitely, e.g. for a target
<em><b>example</b></em> they must be quoted as
<P>
<B>${example.ctor}</B> (constructor)
and
<B>${example.dtor}</B> (destructor)
<P>
If defined, the constructor is applied before any subtargets, and the destructor
is made afterwards, otherwise (default) no such target is applied.
<P>
<B>Note:</B> The constructor/destructor variables <EM>must</EM> be defined before
the rule files is included.
<P>
<B>Note:</B> The destructor target is a dependency of the target, i.e. it is
made <EM>before</EM> the target rules are executed. The destructor rule is only
useful for empty targets, which depend on others, i.e. in the following way:
<PRE>
all: ${all.ctor} all.run ${all.dtor}

all.run:
	echo Doing something...
</PRE>
This way <B>${all.ctor}</B> and <B>${all.dtor}</B> may specify targets, whose rules are made
before/after the <EM>all.run</EM> target.
