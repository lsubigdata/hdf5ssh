<H1>Makesystem configuration</H1>
Configuration data for the make configuration system to be provided by the
application developer (writer of GNUmakefile.rules) or derived from
such are stored in files <TT>${MAKE_ROOT}/make/*.cfg</TT>,
of which <TT>${MAKE_ROOT}/make/make.cfg</TT> is the main `<B>configuration
includer</B>' which should be included in the <a href="GNUmakefile.rules.html">
GNUmakefile.rules</a> file of the application(s) and includes other
configuration files as required. System specific data are mostly set from environment
variables, to have the make configuration system work properly, please set the
following environment/make variables:
<P>
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=10>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP> <a href="GNUmakefile.rules"><TT><B>MAKE_ROOT</B></TT></a> </TD><TD>

       the absolute path of your (application) top directory to which the
       make configuration system is to be applied
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><TT><B> MAKE_UNAME</B></TT>  </TD><TD>
     the type of your machine, typically the output of uname, <BR>
	e.g. using ksh, type <TT>export MAKE_UNAME=$(uname)</TT><BR>
	     using csh, type <TT>setenv MAKE_UNAME `uname'</TT>
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><TT><B> MAKE_CFG</B></TT> </TD><TD>
        indication as to the compiler configuration you would like to use,
        predefined by way of shorthands appearing in config file names,
	e.g. <TT>Debug, Optimize, ...</TT>, usually implies specific 
        setting of compiler flags, have a look into the config files
        themselves for more information.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><TT><B> MAKE_HOSTNAME</B></TT> </TD><TD>
	 the hostname of your computer, for host-specific config files 
	 (normally needs not to be set)
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
The file <TT><A HREF="autoselect.html">${MAKE_ROOT}/make/autoselect.cfg</A></TT> may
be included before including <TT>${MAKE_ROOT}/make/make.cfg</TT> 
to automatically set the <TT>${MAKE_UNAME}</TT> and <TT>${MAKE_HOSTNAME}</TT> variables.
<TT>${MAKE_CFG}</TT> is set to <TT>Debug</TT>, if not set otherwise.
<P>
Configuration (setting of relevant make variables) is done hierarchically:
<UL>
<LI> General settings
<LI> platform-specific
<LI> compiler configuration-specific
<LI> host-specific
<LI> user-specific (also in the same hierarchy: general, platform, 
     compiler configuration, host-specific)
</UL>
At each level, settings from the more general hierarchy level may be overriden in a lower
level. Some levels are optional, e.g. a compiler configuration file is not
necessarily required.
<P>
The configuration includer then includes the following files (leading `-' means that 
this file is optional):
<PRE>
 include $(MAKE_ROOT)/make/arch-default.cfg
-include $(MAKE_ROOT)/make/arch-$(MAKE_UNAME).cfg
 include $(MAKE_ROOT)/make/arch-$(MAKE_UNAME)-$(MAKE_CFG).cfg

# Host specific configurations
-include $(MAKE_ROOT)/make/hosts/arch-$(MAKE_UNAME)-$(MAKE_CFG)-$(MAKE_HOSTNAME).cfg

# User specific configurations
-include $(HOME)/make/arch.cfg
-include $(HOME)/make/arch-$(MAKE_UNAME).cfg
-include $(HOME)/make/arch-$(MAKE_UNAME)-$(MAKE_CFG).cfg
-include $(HOME)/make/arch-$(MAKE_UNAME)-$(MAKE_CFG)-$(MAKE_HOSTNAME).cfg
</PRE>
A configuration file for the specified <TT>${MAKE_UNAME}</TT> and <TT>${MAKE_CFG}</TT> must exist, otherwise
make will terminate with an error message.
In addition to the platform and configuration specific settings
a host specific configuration may be used from the <TT>${MAKE_ROOT}/make/hosts/</TT> subdirectory,
e.g. to override variable settings to specify non-standard directory locations
of locally installed libraries.
<P>
If the make configuration system is used by more than one user, any user may 
provide a local make configuration by creating a <TT>make/</TT>
subdirectory in his home directory.
The structure of local files there has to be compatible with that of the
 <TT>${MAKE_ROOT}</TT> directory.
These local files are included after the <TT>${MAKE_ROOT}</TT> files and
therefore override the global settings.
<P>
Identical system architectures may be indicated by symbolic links to the directories
in the <TT>make/</TT> subdirectory; there is no need for
if-statements, which are possible in GNU make, or for perl/sed script invocation. 
<P>
The configuration includer also defines the architecture-specific make variables 
<B><TT>OBJ_PATH</TT></B> to specife
where to put compiled object files and
<B><TT>LIB_PATH</TT></B> to specify where to put library files.
These directories may different, this way the entire object file tree
may be removed while retaining the created libraries. The filename 
pattern (string) that identifies the current architecture is
stored in the make variable <B><TT>${arch}</TT></B>.
<P>
Suffixes (make rules) are predefined in <TT>$(MAKE_ROOT)/make/suffixes.rules</TT>
<P>
For more details, please have a look into the file <TT>make.cfg</TT>.
