<H3>Introduction: A makefile configuration system</H3>

The purpose of this makefile configuration system is to handle
inter-dependencies that arise when `making' an application system
that consists of numerous components, also known as `libraries',
but the components may also include executables. Others call them
`packages' to have a more general name for shared libraries which
explicitely at runtime, here we call them `targets' since they do
indeed appear as targets in makefiles.
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Why not `configure'?<P>
     `configure' is mainly used for configuring a single library to interface with
     a specific platform. While this works well if nothing goes wrong, applications
     using multiple libraries often have to call configure for each library and try to keep
     the various compilation options consistent (e.g. System C compiler, GNU C compiler,
     various incompatible compiler switches, and much more). 
     <P>
     This often leads to problems, and the best solution (as can be found in
     many applications) probably is to provide
     a common makefile subsection, which contains all the relevant
     makefile variable settings and is used by several or all components
     (`targets').
     <P>
     This is the basic concept of this makefile
     configuration system and should not simply be considered as a 
     workaround of some `configure'-utility problems.
     <P>
     Moreover default `configure' does not provide features like VPATH-based compilation
     (i.e. developing code for multiple platforms in the same source code directory without
     the need of reconfiguring) and some other features mentioned later.
	<P>

<LI> Why not `imake'? <P>
     Imake is quite X-Window based and not that useful for applications which should be
     compiled and used completely independent of X-Windows installations. Also the
     same limitations as before apply, in particular the non-availability of using
     VPATH-based compilation
	<P>

<LI> IFs in makefiles <P>
     Conditional expressions of some kind are required in
     makefiles to keep them platform-independent.
     This can be done in <A HREF="if.html">several ways</A>.
     Please have a look into this section to get a better insight on how this
     makefile configuration system works and how to use these ideas in `derived'
     makefiles (i.e. target makefiles).

<P>
<LI> Comparison to similar makefile configuration systems:<P>
	<UL>
	<LI> The <A HREF="http://www.ocean.org/">Linux Kernel</A>
		uses the environment/variable <TT>$TOPDIR</TT> to include a
		file <TT><B>$(TOPDIR)/Rules.make</B></TT> for the makefiles in
		the ocean subdirectories. 
		The mechanisms provided by this makefile configuration system
		are a similar, but more general structure of this idea,
		such that it can be easily reused
		and adapted to other applications. Hereby the single <TT>Rules.make</TT>
		is split up into various includeable make sections, each containing
		sections which are commonly used. 
	<P>
	<LI>
	    <A HREF="http://www.geom.umn.edu/docs/software/viz/visualization/">Geomview</A>
	    uses the make variable <TT>$GEOM</TT> to include global makefile definitions:
<PRE>
GEOM = ../../..
include ${GEOM}/makefiles/Makedefs.global
include Makedefs
include ${GEOM}/makefiles/Makerules.src
</PRE>
	This is similar to this makefile configuration system, too. Nethertheless
	the makefile configuration systems tries to enable the target makefiles to
	be completely application independent.

<H3> Availability </H3>

The makefile configuration system was orginally developed for
the <A HREF="http://www.photon.at/~werner/light++/">Light++ Raytracing Library</A>,
and was then extended to be 
used in <A HREF="http://amira.zib.de/">Amira</A>, 
<A HREF="http://www.zib.de/">ZIB</A>'s visualization framework, but it is not restricted to 
these applications
and may be used for completely different applications. It would be desireable to
make as many applications/libraries as possible use this configuration system, 
such that more applications/libraries become compatible.
<P>
MCS is available via <A HREF="http://www.photon.at/sw/dist/make.tgz">http://www.photon.at/sw/dist/make.tgz</A>.
The distribution file is updated from internal CVS automatically every night; however,
there are not much changes in the make system any more.

<H3> Feature list </H3>

This list gives an overview of all available features.

<UL>
<LI> Modular makefile construction
<LI> Components can be used in multiple applications without changing the component's
     Makefile

<H3> Detailed description and usage tutorial </H3>

The basic structure of an application using this makefile configuration system
consists of three parts:
<UL>
<LI> A <TT><B>make/</B></TT> subdirectory which contains all `ocean' files 
     of this makefile configuration system, i.e. the subdir from 
     <A HREF="http://www.photon.at/make/">cvs -d :pserver:cvs@www.photon.at:/photoncvs co make</A>.
	<P>    
<LI> For each target a specific <TT><B><A HREF="GNUmakefile.html">GNUmakefile</A></B></TT> 
     which is independent
     of the surrounding application, but adheres to the conventions of this
     makefile configuration system and has to be provided by the developer 
     of the target. Providing such a makefile is made as simple as possible, 
	it mainly has to provide a list of object files, a target name and
	has to include the rules file (next paragraph). Nethertheless, if some
	target <I>requires</I> some special, complicated rules, they can
	be done here anyway.
     <P>    
<LI> An application-specific file <TT><B><A HREF="GNUmakefile.rules.html">GNUmakefile.rules</A></B></TT> 
	which is included by all application target GNUmakefiles and acts as an interface
	between the application targets and the makefile configuration system.
	This file has to be provided by the developer of the application 
	framework.
</UL>

The idea is that all command processing with respect to generating and
handling targets (and more) should be cast into rules to be deposited
in the GNUmakefile.rules file and developers of individual targets just
have to specify that such are to be generated and their dependencies, e.g.
specify that a library is to be created and which object files should go
into it. That, of course, can always be done by splitting GNUmakefiles
into `header' and `rules' sections such that a header section contains
make variable definitions only and a rules sections contains rules only,
making use of data passed via make variables only and providing targets
for a header section - this way a rules section can be used for several
header sections simply by inclusion. What the makefile configuration system
offers in addition is a predefined set of rules that covers a range of
typical requirements and thus does not have to be rewritten for each
application. If required, however, the basic rules of the makefile
configuration system may be extended or even replaced, in this case great 
care must be exercised by the writer of the GNUmakefile.rules file who has 
to decide how the targets should be handled in the context of the entire
application.
<P>
The <A HREF="concept.html">directory structure</A> of a typical application
is usually hidden with respect to an application target.
The developer of an application target (a library etc.) does not need to know where
to put compiled binaries, this is determined by specific rules contained in the
application's <TT>GNUmakefile.rules</TT> file.

<P>
The <B><TT><A HREF="GNUmakefile.html">GNUmakefile</A></TT></B> of an application target is
conceptually as simple as possible such that the developer of a target does not have
to deal with complicated makefiles to keep his target compatible with the rest of
the application's code. Basically, he only needs to specify a name for his target and
a list of object files which are part of it.
<P>
The main task when adopting this makefile configuration system to a specific 
application is to provide a good 
<B><TT><A HREF="GNUmakefile.rules.html">GNUmakefile.rules</A></TT></B> file which 
takes care of all its requirements. For convenience the makefile
configuration system provides a couple of make `modules' (aka `rule files'), 
i.e. makefile subsections, in seperate files, each covering a single possible
requirement of an application's rule file.

All rule files provide some <A HREF="rules.html">common properties</A>, e.g. 
a help target. In each application target subdirectory an overview of all
available make targets can be obtained by

<SMALL>1: Name is not yet decided:<BR>
`<EM>Metamake</EM>' could be a name, since this makefile configuration system
manages many other makefiles.<BR>
`<EM>make++</EM>' could be a name, since this configuration system has some
object-oriented like features, similar to C++.<BR>
`<EM>MCS</EM>' could be an abbreviation of `makefile configuration system'.<BR>
Any other name suggestion is welcome.
